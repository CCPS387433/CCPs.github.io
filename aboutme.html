<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am working towards being consistent in everything that I want, the experience that led me here was realizing that in order to get what I want I must be consistent, and have discipline if I do not have any of those traits I will honestly get nowhere in life. Most things in life require consistency and discipline, for example, saving up for a house, which requires you to learn how to not spend as much as you would want to. 

 I am working on these goals by creating the right mindset, and just doing the things I need to get done without thinking if it's too easy or if it's way too hard. This also leads to consistency when don't think too hard about the things that need to get done, it's a bit easier to get them done.

 For me to be successful I must carry the values of being consistent, disciplined, and responsible. These values are very important because when you are consistent with what you want it's most likely going to come your way.

 Some short-term goals are for me to attend college, try a new hobby, and develop a better morning routine.

 I want to be known as courageous, intelligent, smart, and ambitious.
